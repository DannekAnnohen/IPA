09 Dec 2018 - work in progress

Issues:
- Tone has heuristic implementation
IPA (Extra High Tone) = ThisFile (Falling Tone)
IPA (Extra Low Tone) = ThisFIle (Rising Tone)

- the matching of IPA symbols and specs is not robustly implemented - the lists rely heavily on their ordering
-> Nothing as a value for lookup xInventory should be dead (can be circumvented?)

To Do:
1. look into VoigtlÃ¤nder paper on bidirectionalization for spellout function 
2. find better solution for xSym and xSpec Lists; make expandable w/o disturbing matching - safe as tuples & xSym? matching should be robust!!! +++ downgrading mSpec & maybe also c/vSpec?
3. non-heuristic tone implementation
4. deal with non-superscript diacritics/symbols
5. specify show for data IPA
-. non-pulmonic consonants
-. more suprasegmentals
-. affricates
-. "other symbols"

Changes 10.12.2018
- changed names: Open -> Openness, Front -> Frontness, Rounded -> Roundedness (& according functions)
- added export list in module header
- changed name: Symbol -> Boundary, converted to xSym, xSpec, xInventory pattern, adjusted parseIPA & IPA
- exported construction functions to IPA_Construct and raw data & data declarations to IPA_Data

Changes 11.12.2018
- completely changed data-type system
- defined parseIPA for non-IPA Chars and made a non-list version parse1
- made parseIPA more elegant
- improved/ unified feat function
- wrote type checking function

Changes 14.12.2018
- improved on type system

Changes 26.12.2018
- parser now merges sounds with diacritics
- solved typing dilemma
- added exceptions to parser
